You are given an integer N, you need to reduce it to 1 in minimum number of operations.
Following operations are allowed.

-> Subtract 1 from it. ( n = n - 1 ) 
-> If its divisible by 2, divide by 2. ( if n % 2 == 0 , then n = n / 2  ) 
-> If its divisible by 3, divide by 3. ( if n % 3 == 0 , then n = n / 3  ).
