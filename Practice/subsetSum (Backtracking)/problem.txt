Subset sum problem is to find subset of elements that are selected from a given set whose sum adds
up to a given number K.
We are considering the set contains non-negative values.
It is assumed that the input set is unique (no duplicates are presented).

example:
Input:
a = {15, 22, 14, 26, 32, 9, 16, 8}
sum = 53

Output:
8 9 14 22
8 14 15 16
15 16 22
